# Public Policy Leaders Program â€“ GIS Workshop Series

The Public Policy Leaders Program (PPLP) is a selective track within Careers in Policy and Social Impact at UChicago Career Advancement that is offered for students who are ambitious about pursuing public sector and social impact careers. The current PPLP cohort comprises of ~150 students who are 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year students. 

**Goals**: Beyond learning about the importance of GIS as a key career skill for those interested in policy-focused roles, we envision several key goals to guide a GIS workshop series: 

1. Learn the purpose of GIS and the basics of the ArcGIS interface. 
2. Explore how and where to procure GIS data, as well as the special data formats of GIS. 
3. Learn about how to build their GIS skills and apply it in a public policy context. 
4. Apply their skills in a basic case study project.
